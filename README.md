# tic_tac_toe

This is a version of your standard game of tic-tac-toe. Some additional pieces I was able to add are:

1.) The ability to player with multiple people (more than 2)

2.) The ability to create your own board dimensions (limted to 26 x 99)

3.) You can choose what the win coniditons are (3, 4, or more in a row)

# How-to Run

If you run the lib/play.rb file, you're off!
